# WhatsappClone Using HTML & CSS Only

HTML

This HTML code is for a web page that appears to be a simplified version of WhatsApp. The page consists of two main sections:

Left Section (Contacts):

At the top, there's a profile picture and some icons for searching, loading, typing, and accessing the menu.
Below that, there's a notification window with an option to enable desktop notifications.
Next is a search bar to find or start a new conversation.
Following that, there's a list of user contacts with their names, profile pictures, last messages, and dates of those messages. Some users have images, while others don't.
At the bottom, there's a note about the encryption of personal messages.
Right Section (Conversation):

At the top, there's the profile picture of the person you're chatting with, along with their name and online status.
There are icons for searching and accessing the menu as well.
The main part contains a list of messages with dates and times, indicating who sent each message. Sent messages have a green background, received messages have a white background, and missed calls have an icon.
Each message also shows a timestamp, and there are options for emoji reactions.
At the bottom, there are tools for sending emojis, attachments, and a text input box to type a message. There's also a microphone icon for voice messages.
Overall, this HTML code sets up a basic interface for a messaging application similar to WhatsApp, allowing users to view their contacts and engage in conversations.
